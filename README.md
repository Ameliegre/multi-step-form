# Frontend Mentor - Multi step form

This challenge is to build out this multi-step form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

 - Complete each step of the sequence
 - Go back to a previous step to update their selections
 - See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
 - View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
 - See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
 - Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made
